Small project for sorting images in a folder into a number of categories given 
by the user based on a GUI generated on-the-fly using Tkinter. 

The only requirement not already packaged with python is the `Pillow` 
library.

Usage

    python sort_folder.py 
        --folder <INPUT-FOLDER> 
        --labels <INPUT-LABEL1> <INPUT-LABEL2> ...
